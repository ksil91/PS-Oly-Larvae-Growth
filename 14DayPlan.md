# Pub-a-thon 14 Day Plan
### Common Garden Phenotype Paper
My plan for the next 2 weeks is to produce a solid draft of my Olympia oyster common garden experiment paper.

* Thursday 4/20: Have methods entirely written up (just need to finish writing up statistical analyses). Upload all figures and raw statistical outputs produced for NSA talk to paper repo.
* Sunday 4/23: Have results written up.
    * Need help with: How to label significance codes on plots
    * Choosing which plots to include
* Thursday 4/27: Have draft or detailed outline of Discussion so others can give comments.
    * Need help with: comments on discussion, especially in light of Jake's project and what we *think* we might get from the genetics/epigentics
* Friday 4/28: Comments for other Pubathoners
* Saturday 4/29: Have draft of Introduction ready for comments
    * Need help with: how to cite Jake's paper? 
    * double-checking that I correctly report the important results from Jake's work
* Tuesday 5/2: Incorporate comments for polished draft

### 2b-RAD/Epigenetics paper
The goal for this project is mostly to organize the data and analyses we've already done so that when a better version of the genome is available, we don't have to search for them and we remember the pipeline for analysis.
* Friday 4/21: Upload raw sequencing files from 2017 sequencing run and .bam/.vcf output files to Owl so others can access. 
* Monday 4/24: Upload markdown notebooks on mapping and loci assembly to paper repo, with links to Owl files. Fill out genomics wiki page with links to raw files.
    * Need help with: how to efficiently scrape file names and read counts to make a table on the wiki page (Sam?)i
    * What files are important to have on Owl? All steps of quality filtering, or just the final products?
* Sunday 4/30 (if done with phenotype paper writing): write up 2b-RAD methods
