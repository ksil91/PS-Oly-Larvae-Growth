# PS-Oly-Larvae-Growth

This is the working repository for our project comparing growth rates among 3 populations of Olympia oysters (*Ostrea lurida*) across life stages.

The draft of the paper can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sx5ARB8pAzIDD9I8zYPgR3NKmfZY_4YXqtkqnGAG2f0/edit?usp=sharing)

Raw photos of tiles with juvenile oysters on them can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/o2jwn0yt9i3i6uq/AAC-jQ0wuYefyxXm1NsX_kq-a?dl=0), organized by time point.
