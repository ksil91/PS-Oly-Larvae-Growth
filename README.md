# PS-Oly-Larvae-Growth

This is the repository for our project comparing growth rates among 3 populations of Olympia oysters (*Ostrea lurida*) across life stages.

The directory with the crazy name contains the Overleaf directory with .tex files to generate the current version of the manuscript, as well as a compiled PDF.

Raw photos of tiles with juvenile oysters on them can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/o2jwn0yt9i3i6uq/AAC-jQ0wuYefyxXm1NsX_kq-a?dl=0), organized by time point.
