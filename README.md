# PS-Oly-Larvae-Growth

This is the working repository for our project comparing growth rates among 3 populations of Olympia oysters (*Ostrea lurida*) across life stages.

The draft of the paper can be found [here]()

The data sheet of the larvae sizes can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BIxMHYU7cHR6nEu_rKnySxjo18M2nFeLKIpkOztB9Uo/edit?usp=sharing).  

Raw photos of tiles with juvenile oysters on them can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/o2jwn0yt9i3i6uq/AAC-jQ0wuYefyxXm1NsX_kq-a?dl=0), organized by time point.
