# PS-Oly-Larvae-Growth

This is the repository for our [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24455-3) comparing growth rates and reproductive timing among 3 Puget Sound populations of Olympia oysters (*Ostrea lurida*) across life stages. 

The Products directory contains an Overleaf directory with .tex files to generate the current version of the manuscript, as well as the PDF from Scientific Reports.

Raw data can be found under data and on [figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5975452).

R scripts used to generate publication figures and reproducible R notebooks (including Github-friendly .md versions) of the analyses used in the paper can be found under Analysis. This is my first try at making reproducible notebooks to go along with a paper and something I plan to continue to do going forward. If you try them out and have any feedback (e.g. on clarity, usefulness) please let me know! 

Raw photos of tiles with juvenile oysters on them can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/o2jwn0yt9i3i6uq/AAC-jQ0wuYefyxXm1NsX_kq-a?dl=0), organized by time point.
